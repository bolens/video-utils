# video-utils delivery playbook

This repository delivers reviewed source and its generated site from `main`.
There is no versioned artifact release workflow. Do not invent release tags or
package publication for documentation or CI maintenance.

## Prepare and validate

Branch from current `origin/main` in a clean worktree. Preserve unrelated work.
Run `make check test-all` using disposable fixtures; report dependency skips.
For catalog/help changes run `make generate` and verify the generated output.
Workflow changes also require `actionlint` and
`zizmor --offline --min-severity medium --min-confidence medium .github`.
Review the full diff and new history for secrets and personal paths.

## Push, merge, and verify

Create a focused Conventional Commit, then run
`git push --set-upstream origin HEAD` and open a PR against `main`.
Require both Python test jobs and every applicable current-head check, review
the complete diff, resolve conversations, and squash-merge. Administrators
follow the same protections. Zero approving reviews support solo maintenance;
force pushes and default-branch deletion are disabled.

Verify CI on the merged SHA and the existing Pages deployment when applicable.
Delete only the verified merged feature branch. Never bypass protection or
use a personal media library as a publication smoke test.

## Recover and future releases

Repair or revert through a new reviewed PR. Preserve source media and existing
outputs during recovery. A future versioned release needs an explicit version
authority, artifact contract, immutable source SHA, verification, and rollback
procedure before its first tag. No product release is needed for this setup.
