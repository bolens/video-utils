# Development environments

Install [Nix and devenv](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/), then run from this checkout:

```sh
devenv shell
repo-check
# Or run the same portable gate non-interactively:
devenv test
```

The shell supplies Python, FFmpeg and ffprobe, Bash, Git, Make, ShellCheck, and GNU utilities. `repo-check` runs the native `make check test-all` gate, including generated documentation, managed-tool integrity, CLI/MCP behavior, and real FFmpeg operations on disposable fixtures. The unittest output reports unavailable codec dependencies. See [requirements.md](requirements.md) and [../tests/README.md](../tests/README.md) for the format and preservation contracts.

Commit `devenv.lock` with deliberate input updates. Local state and `devenv.local.nix` / `devenv.local.yaml` overrides are ignored. Existing Nix cache settings are used without changing daemon trust.

## Docker and Podman

Build and load the development image, then run a command with a local engine:

```sh
python3 scripts/development-container.py build podman
python3 scripts/development-container.py run podman -- make check test-all
# Substitute docker for podman to use Docker.
```

Omit the command for an interactive Bash shell. The helper mounts the checkout at `/workspace`, runs with the caller's UID/GID, and uses Podman's keep-id mapping. It forwards arguments and exit status without constructing a shell command. These mounts require a local engine with access to the checkout path; remote Docker daemons need their own source transfer. Paths containing commas are rejected because they cannot be represented by this mount syntax.

The image contains tools, not checkout files. Build archives live under `.devenv/containers/` and are never uploaded by the helper. Existing production images and Compose stacks are separate from this development image.

## Apple container

[Apple container](https://github.com/apple/container) requires a supported Apple-silicon Mac. Start its runtime according to Apple's installation guide. With a Linux Nix builder configured:

```sh
python3 scripts/development-container.py build apple
python3 scripts/development-container.py run apple -- make check test-all
```

The helper exports an OCI archive and uses `container image load`. Native ARM Macs target `aarch64-linux`; x86 Linux builds target `x86_64-linux`. [Building Linux images from macOS requires a Linux builder](https://devenv.sh/containers/). This workflow does not assume Apple container implements Docker Compose or Docker's daemon API.

Apple execution is not verified by Linux tests. The product targets GNU/Linux. Native macOS checks exercise the development toolset; use a Linux container for Linux runtime behavior. FFmpeg encoder availability determines format coverage. Tests use disposable generated media and retain sources.
