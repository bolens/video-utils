# Video preservation utilities constitution

[Documentation](../../docs/README.md)

## Core principles

### I. Domain verification

Video operations use ffmpeg and ffprobe with supported local protocols and demuxers. Declare stream selection, codecs, remux versus transcode behavior, metadata handling, and output verification.

### II. Preserve sources and destinations

Source files MUST remain intact. Writes require `--apply`, verified temporary
outputs, and no-clobber publication. Reject input symlinks and destination
collisions. Preserve filename bytes through argument arrays; never use shell
evaluation for filenames.

### III. One catalog and shared engine

`lib/catalog.json` owns tool identity and generated surfaces. Thin Bash wrappers
call the shared Python engine; domain behavior belongs in `lib/domain.py`.
Imports MUST have no operational side effects. Keep Python 3.11 compatibility.

### IV. Explicit local authority

Commands are offline and MUST NOT install packages, delete sources, or access a
personal library during tests. MCP is local stdio, read-only, and limited to
configured roots. Do not broaden its authority without a reviewed contract.

### V. Executable evidence

Use disposable fixtures and isolated HOME/XDG/TMPDIR values. Preserve exit codes
0 success, 1 operation failure, and 2 usage/dependency failure. Run
`make check test-all` before publication and report every dependency skip.

## Governance

Use `AGENTS.md` to select architecture, requirements, and testing documentation
for the affected contract. Safety or compatibility exceptions need explicit rationale,
acceptance evidence, and a constitution version update.
