# Feature specification: Video preservation and local library tools

**Created**: 2026-09-05
**Status**: Retrospective baseline
**Inspected revision**: `e84308419941a818d6a06c079afda184d4f3b5d5`
**Input**: The owner requested a fleet-wide Spec Kit retrofit and implementation audit.

FFmpeg and ffprobe inspect local streams, remux containers, and create explicit viewing derivatives.

This specification records existing contracts after implementation. It does not
claim that the original work followed Spec Kit. New behavior requires a separate
change contract. Existing feature specifications remain authoritative within their
own scope.

## User scenarios and testing

### User story 1: Plan a conversion before writing (P1)

An operator selects local files and a catalog command.

**Acceptance**: Without --apply, the command reports planned destinations and leaves sources and outputs unchanged.

### User story 2: Publish verified outputs while retaining sources (P2)

An operator explicitly applies a conversion using disposable fixtures.

**Acceptance**: A valid conversion is verified before no-clobber publication. Corruption, unsupported operations, and collisions produce nonzero status without publishing failed output.

### User story 3: Inspect a collection through CLI or restricted MCP (P3)

An operator inventories files, computes manifests, compares trees, or requests a permitted read-only MCP operation.

**Acceptance**: Summaries do not read media contents, hashes round-trip through verification, and MCP refuses paths outside its configured roots and all write commands.

## Requirements

- **FR-001**: The catalog MUST own tool names, operation selection, wrappers, and generated documentation.
- **FR-002**: Writes MUST require --apply, retain source bytes, refuse existing destinations, and verify staged output before publication.
- **FR-003**: Discovery MUST preserve unusual filenames, reject input symlinks, apply explicit exclusions before work, and reject ambiguous destinations.
- **FR-004**: Video operations MUST restrict input protocols and demuxers, preserve all streams for remuxing, and verify decoded output before publication.
- **FR-005**: Shared library tools MUST provide inventory, summary, exact duplicate hashes, manifests, hash verification, tree comparison, and path auditing without deleting source files.
- **FR-006**: MCP MUST remain local stdio, expose only read operations, require allowed roots, and reject unknown arguments.
- **FR-007**: Batch execution MUST bound outstanding jobs, preserve result ordering, retain successful outputs, and report partial failures with nonzero exit status.

## Success criteria

- **SC-001**: Every requirement has a named source owner and acceptance check in `coverage.md`.
- **SC-002**: The listed native checks pass for the reviewed candidate, with unavailable environments and operational checks recorded separately.
- **SC-003**: Retrofitting preserves existing interfaces and completed specifications. Any confirmed implementation gap is corrected under an explicit requirement before it is marked complete.

## Edge cases and operational limits

Validation uses disposable fixtures. No personal library or live service is involved. Native codec support is bounded by docs/requirements.md and docs/formats.md. Docker runtime and hosted delivery retain their existing separate checks. Source delivery does not authorize a new version tag.
